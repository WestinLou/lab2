    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Yiqun Wang, and I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Idaho.
        One of the courses I'm most excited about this semester is my database course.
        The reason I took this course is to improve my SQL skills, and I'm also very interested in the field of
        information management systems.
        <br><br>
        As someone passionate about technology, I've always wanted to explore various aspects of Computer Science.
        My goal through this course is not just academic excellence but also to gain practical skills that I can apply
        in real-world scenarios.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        When I'm not busy with my academic or coding projects, I like to engage in various activities.
        I'm fond of socializing, which not only helps me unwind but also broadens my horizons by meeting people from
        diverse backgrounds.
        <br><br>
