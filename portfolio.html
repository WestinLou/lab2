    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>
      Over the years, I have worked on several projects that span across different domains of computer science.
      From front-end web development to back-end services, my projects reflect my passion for learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.
      <br><br>
      Each project has been a learning journey, pushing me to explore new technologies, debugging techniques, and problem-solving skills.
      Below are some of the projects that I'm most proud of.
